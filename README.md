Number Guessing Game in C
A robust, terminal-based implementation of the classic number guessing game, developed as a fundamental programming project in C. This project demonstrates basic algorithm design, random number generation, and user input validation.

🚀 Features
Random Target Generation: Utilizes the <time.h> and <stdlib.h> libraries to ensure a unique target number for every session.

Input Validation: Robust handling of non-integer inputs to prevent program crashes or infinite loops.

Attempt-Based Logic: A limited number of attempts (5) to increase the challenge and gameplay value.

Clear Feedback: Real-time guidance on whether the target number is higher or lower than the current guess.

Special Achievement: Custom logic to recognize and reward a "first-attempt" win.

🛠️ Technical Details
Language: C (Standard C library)

Concepts Used:

Standard Input/Output (stdio.h)

Control Flow (While loops, If-Else statements)

Randomization (srand, rand)

Memory and Variable Management
